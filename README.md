## Description:
Collecting and analysing large number of samples may often be expensive, although necessary for several studies. Infrared spectroscopy is a high-throughput, non-destructive, and cheap sensing method that has a large range of applications in agricultural, plant and environmental sciences.  The inherent complexity of infrared data makes necessary the use of advanced statistical tools to extract relevant information from a sample of a given material (e.g. soil). 
The course intends to present a tutorial on multivariate analysis using the R statistical Software, with focus on chemometric methods (i.e. calibration of infrared spectral data). We will present in particular methods that are dedicated for the pre-processing and calibration of soil spectroscopic data. We will show how we can integrate different tools (publicly available R packages developed by the authors) for performing efficiently data exploration and data mining for advanced research. 
This one-day workshop begins with an introduction on infrared spectroscopy. The participants learn how to select the optimal number of samples for building accurate multivariate models. But calibrating the raw spectra may lead to poor quantitative estimates. Therefore the second part of the workshop focus on signal processing, outlier detection, dimensionality reduction and similarity/dissimilarity measures between spectra.  This part also includes computer examples in which the participants learn how to analyse and pre-process soil spectra using the R language.
Finally, the lecture will review how to use chemometric methods specifically developed to deal with complex soil infrared data. During the computer practical a raw soil spectra dataset and R-codes are provided.
